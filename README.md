#Assignment1: Feature Generation

Text categorization is the task on classifying a set of documents into categories from a set of predefined labels. Texts cannot be directly handled by our model. The indexing procedure is the first step that maps a text dj into a numeric representation during the training and validation. The standard TFIDF function is used to represent the text. The unique words from English vocabulary are represented as a dimension of the dataset.




#Assignment2: Clustering
Use the public dataset to implement the K-means algorithm.



#Assignment3: Nonparameter-modelling
• Use the public dataset UCI Iris to implement the Parzen window and KNN algorithm, where the dataset is downloaded from the following website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/
• Warnings: For KNN and Parzen algorithms, there is no training stage.
